# Fortran tester {#mainpage}

`tester` is a Fortran module to test Fortran programs. It provides routines to
check equality or closeness between variables and counting the errors.

A minimal example:

	program test
	  use tester
	  implicit none

	  type(tester_t) :: my_tester

	  call my_tester% init()

	  call my_tester% assert_equal(1+1, 2)

	  call my_tester% print()

	end program test

If none of the tests fail, the `print` method displays the message
`fortran_tester: all tests succeeded`.
Else, the program will exit with a nonzero error code, making it suitable for
use as an automated test.
